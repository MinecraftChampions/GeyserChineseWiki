    - title: Geyser 是如何工作的？
      content: |
        Geyser 像一个翻译官那样工作，将传入和传出的数据包翻译为客户端和服务端（服务器） 都能理解的格式。这样说来，它模拟了 Minecraft Java版 客户端，因此服务器实际上认为您是从 Java版本 加入的。无论是什么服务器以及它安装了什么插件，您都可以将其与 Geyser 连接（只要服务器支持最新的Minecraft版本）。

    - title: 红石是按照哪个版本工作的？
      content: |
        红石，还有 指令、农场 等各种机制都是按照 Java版 工作的。因为你加入的服务器是一个 Java版 服务器。

    - title: Geyser 是付费的吗?
      content: |
        不，Geyser 和 它的相关一切作品 都是 免费且开源的，且遵循 MIT 协议。

    - title: 哪些插件不兼容 Geyser？
      content: |
        Geyser 应当和大部分 服务端插件 兼容，但总有例外，例如：

        * [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/) 如果你没有购买付费计划，需要关闭该插件的 only-allow-proxy-connections 选项。然而，如果你购买了付费计划，则无需担心，因为他们的付费计划有对 Geyser 添加额外支持。

        Floodgate 与修改登录流程的插件不兼容。请务必注意以下各个支持离线登录的插件只是为了 Wiki 编写，Geyser 官方不对离线服务器提供帮助支持
        
        * [DynamicBungeeAuth](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/27480/) 使得基岩版玩家生成无效的登录请求。
        * [FastLogin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/14153/) 不让 Floodgate 为基岩版玩家添加前缀。
        * [ExploitFixer](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/62842/) 认为 Floodgate 玩家使用 恶意UUID - 请关闭该插件的 uuidspoof 配置。
        * [JPremium](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/27766/) 改变 Floodgate 玩家的 UUID，导致 Floodgate API 等可能存在异常。
        * [LibHatesMods](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/78202/) 造成玩家无法登录，且报错： `com.github.steveice10.mc.auth.exception.request.InvalidCredentialsException`
        * [ProtocolSupport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/7201/) ~~虽然兼容Floodgate.~~ 但是建议使用 [ViaBackwards](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/27448/).
        * [ProtocolSupportBungee](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/8733/) 破坏 Floodgate 玩家登录流程，导致 Floodgate API 等可能存在异常。
        * [SayNoToMcLeaks](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/40906/) 破坏 Floodgate 玩家登录流程，导致 Floodgate API 等可能存在异常。
        
        如果你发现其他不兼容情况，可通过 [Discord](http://discord.gg/geysermc) 联系GeyserMC.

    - title: Geyser-Spigot 支持什么版本?
      content: |
        Geyser-Spigot插件支持1.13.2及以上的版本. 插件不支持任何早期版本 - 请改用代理端版本或独立版本。
        由于Geyser模拟了 {{ site.data.versions.java }} 的Java客户端连接, 所以你需要 [安装 ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) <br>

        为了让基岩版玩家在 1.19.3+ 发消息 或者在 1.19.1/1.19.2 加入, 你需要禁用消息签名， 详见 [消息签名](geyser/secure-chat/). <br>

        运行Geyser需要使用Java16及其以上版本的Java. 如果你不知道如何安装Java，请阅读 [安装Java](https://docs.papermc.io/misc/java-install) .
        不支持 Java 16 的 Paper 版本可以在 Java 启动参数中添加 `-DPaper.IgnoreJavaVersion=true` 以支持Paper运行在Java16及其以上的版本.

    - title: 我应该使用哪个版本的 插件版Geyser？
      content: |
        独立版可以加入任何平台的服务器
        * Geyser-Spigot 支持:
          * [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)
          * [Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads) (推荐)
          * 其他Spigot分支
        * Geyser-Bungee 支持:
          * [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/)
          * [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/downloads#Waterfall)
          * 其他BungeeCord分支
        * Geyser-Velocity 支持 [Velocity](https://www.velocitypowered.com/)
        * Geyser-Sponge 支持 [SpongeVanilla 或 SpongeForge](https://www.spongepowered.org/)
        * Geyser-Fabric 支持 [Fabric](https://www.fabricmc.net/),但需要Fabric Api

    - title: 哪种Geyser版本最好,插件还是独立版?
      content: |
        建议使用插件

    - title: 如果我使用 BungeeCord，那么 Geyser/Floodgate 应该放置到哪?
      content: |
        你只需要在你的 BungeeCord 服务器安装 Geyser/Floodgate，这是在你的服务器不使用 Floodgate API 的情况下。如果不是这种情况，你还需要在每个子服都正确安装 Floodgate。

    - title: 我应该给基岩版玩家什么 IP？
      content: |
        一般来说，如果你没有自己修改过，那么你的基岩版玩家连接你的服务器的IP应该和你的 Java版玩家 一样。至于端口，则根据你的 Geyser 配置下的 bedrock 下的 port 选项来决定。

    - title: 我如何让基岩版玩家加载资源包？
      content: |
        你可以在 Geyser 下的 `packs`  文件夹放置资源包。基岩版客户端在加入服务器时会自动下载资源包。目前没有 Java-基岩 资源包自动转换 的功能，如果你需要转换资源包格式，请前往 [转换工具](https://rtm516.github.io/ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock/) 并把转换好的资源包放置在 Geyser 内。

    - title: 基岩版玩家如何副手拿物品？
      content: |
        你可以使用指令 `/geyser offhand`  来进行 主手和副手 的切换。你也可以通过修改 Geyser 下的配置 (`emote-offhand-workaround`) 来使得基岩版通过游戏里的 表情 按钮来进行 主手和副手 的切换。

    - title: 在使用 Floodgate 时，执行指令的玩家变量是什么？
      content: |
        If there is a prefix on Floodgate players, you must include the prefix in the name. Floodgate also replaces all spaces in names with underscores, so be sure to replace any spaces with underscores when executing the command. If this does not work, put double quotes around the name.

        Example: `/tp ".<bedrock_username>"`

    - title: How do I add players to the whitelist when using Floodgate?
      content: |
        There are three ways you can do this.

        1. Use Floodgate’s built-in whitelist command: `/fwhitelist add <bedrock_username>`. This will only work if the player has joined any Geyser server already.

        2. Turn off the whitelist using `/whitelist off`, then get the Geyser player to join. After that, run `/whitelist add ".<bedrock_username>"`, and finally, turn the whitelist back on using `/whitelist on`. 
        When using Local Linking: If you're linking a Bedrock account to an existing whitelisted Java account, you don't need to whitelist the Bedrock account separately. You can link the accounts and immediately turn the whitelist back on.

        3. Add the player’s UUID, as given by Floodgate, to the `whitelist.json` file. Then, run `/whitelist reload` to update the whitelist.

        Choose the method that suits your preferences and server setup.

    - title: How do I find a player's UUID without them joining when using Floodgate?
      content: |
        Use [this page.](https://uuid.kejona.dev/) If this doesn't work, then try this method:
        
        First, you'll need to get the XUID of the player. There are several third-party websites to find this, for example, [this one](https://cxkes.me/xbox/xuid) (unaffiliated with Geyser). Make sure to choose "Hexidecimal." You'll need to enter the player's Xbox Gamertag, and, once submitted, it should display the XUID in the format of `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. To turn the XUID into a UUID that Java Edition can recognize, you need to put the XUID in this format: `00000000-0000-0000-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. If formatted right, Java Edition should accept it as a UUID.

    - title: Can I remove the prefix of Floodgate players?
      content: |
        While you can remove the prefix, it is generally recommended not to remove the prefix to prevent situations where player usernames are the same on both editions (Ex: Bedrock Username: `JohnDoe`, Java Username: `JohnDoe`). While they have different UUIDs, they have the same username, which may cause conflicts with commands that involve a player name. If you want to remove the prefix to use commands, Try adding quotation marks around the name. Example: `/tp ".<bedrock_username>"` Otherwise, the prefix is located in the Floodgate `config.yml` under `username-prefix:`.

    - title: Do I need Floodgate in order to use Geyser?
      content: |
        No; Floodgate is only required if you wish to allow Bedrock clients to join without authenticating to Java servers. Without the Floodgate plugin, Geyser can either authenticate to Mojang in online mode, or join without authentication in an offline mode server (though this is unsupportable and dangerous as anyone can join your server and is against Mojang's EULA).

    - title: Sometimes, when I go really far out, the world starts to experience very odd visual bugs...
      content: |
        This is a Bedrock client issue caused by Bedrock being 32-bit and Java being 64-bit. For more information read [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition_distance_effects).

    - title: Can I use Geyser to allow Java players to connect to my Bedrock server?
      content: |
        No, this is a translation tool to allow Bedrock players to connect to Java servers. It does not work the opposite way.

    - title: Can I use Geyser with Pterodactyl Panel?
      content: |
        Yes, you can use Geyser as a plugin or a mod for your Minecraft server software running on Pterodactyl. There is also an official egg for the standalone version. It supports auto-updating and has all config options easily editable. You can find it [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/pterodactyl-stuff), download the JSON egg, and import it into your panel. Make sure the Geyser port (using UDP) is exported out to the host & allocated the port to the server.

    - title: Can I use Geyser with Ngrok?
      content: |
        Unfortunately, Ngrok is TCP-only, so you will not be able to use Geyser with Ngrok. As an alternative, you can use [playit.gg](https://playit.gg), which supports both TCP and UDP.

    - title: How do I setup Cosmic Guard?
      content: |
        1. You will need access to the host systems terminal. Note: This guide is for Linux systems only!
        2. Setup a "Guard" select gaming then Minecraft: Bedrock edition.
        3. Click setup for linux and run the guardian installer and start the service.
        4. Run "guardian status" and take note of the "Local IP" it starts with "10.31.x.x".
        5. Go to the Geyser config.yml and update the Bedrock address to the Local IP which you found above.
        6. Restart the mc server and test it out, it should work for both Java and Bedrock.

    - title: Can I connect Geyser to an older server?
      content: |
        If the server has ViaVersion and/or supports the latest Minecraft version, yes. However, we are unable to support older versions of Minecraft due to a limitation in our Java support library.

    - title: Can I connect Geyser to a modded (Forge/Fabric) server?
      content: |
        The short answer: if a vanilla client can join the server, then so can Geyser.

        The long answer: currently, there is no way for Geyser to translate the features that most mods add (blocks, items, etc.). Therefore, servers that require mods to be installed clientside are unsupportable through Geyser.

    - title: How can I auto-update Geyser?
      content: |
        GeyserUpdater ([GitHub page](https://github.com/ProjectG-Plugins/GeyserUpdater)/[Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/88555/)) is a Spigot/BungeeCord plugin option for auto-updating. Please note that this plugin is also unaffiliated and unsupported by Geyser, and users should redirect support for the plugin to its [Discord](https://discord.gg/U5MC2tcCz9).

    - title: How can I make DiscordSRV show Floodgate 2.0 or GeyserSkinManager skins?
      content: |
        Replace the `AvatarUrl` line in your DiscordSRV config with this: `AvatarUrl: https://mc-heads.net/avatar/{texture}/{size}.png`

        Note: you need to be running DiscordSRV v1.22.0 or newer. Floodgate 2.0 or GeyserSkinRestorer is still required for skins to show up for Java players and for this to work.

        Alternatively, if you cannot get the above AvatarUrl to work with DiscordSRV, or you'd like to use it with another plugin that does not support texture ids, you can use the [TydiumCraft Skin API.](https://tydiumcraft.net/docs/skinapi)

    - title: Can I use Buycraft (Tebex) with Geyser?
      content: |
        You sure can! Buycraft supports Java & Bedrock players via the Offline store mode **(Recommended to be used with Floodgate)**

        **(Currently, Buycraft does not support special symbols like `*` or `-`, so you'll have to change the Floodgate prefix to `_` or remove it entirely.)**
        ### Steps to create a store to support both versions        
        - Buycraft-> Create Webstore
        - Select Game-> Minecraft Offline
        - Continue-> Click "Create my Webstore"

    - title: Adding custom Geyser translation overrides
      content: |
        Please note that you cannot add strings that work in Minecraft formatting - these strings are only for places where Geyser uses them.

        To start, create a `languages` folder in the same directory as the Geyser config file.
        Inside of it, you'll need to add a file with your desired locale ending in `.properties`. You can see
        [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/languages/tree/master/texts) for the locale files that Geyser uses - 
        you can download these as a starting point, or you can just add the strings you want to overwrite. 

        You must restart Geyser for the changes to apply.

  items:
    - title: What is the relationship between CubeCraft and Geyser?
      content: |
        Redned started Geyser in July 2019. In May 2020, CubeCraft acquired the GeyserMC brand. This means that they govern the project (though at this time, they govern lightly). CubeCraft does not own the code of Geyser.

    - title: Does CubeCraft use Geyser?
      content: |
        No
